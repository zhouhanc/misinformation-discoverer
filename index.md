### What problem does Misinformation Discoverer address?

Misinformation is a persistent theat on today's Internet. The content of future misinformation (or fake news) is inherently unpredictable. So how do we discover potential fake news source preemptively? The idea is to focus on non-content signals, such as HTML page layouts or social network patterns. Misinformation Discoverer is an automated discovery system based on this _content-agnostic_ approach. This repository is updated daily with newly discovered fake news domains. If you want to examine our data collection in a more interactive mode, please check our websites on [Domain Network Visualization](https://discover.misinfotracer.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Misinfo Tracer](https://misinfotracer.com/){:target="_blank"}.

*Example of a domain-domain interaction network. Each node is a domain, and two nodes are connected if users who share those two domains overlap above a threshold. Different color represents different communities, generated by Louvain clustering algorithm. The color assignment is arbitrary. 

### How does Misinformation Discoverer work?

Misinformation Discoverer is powered by a combination of unsupervised domain clustering and supervised domain classification algorithms. The systems works in three steps:
1. Collect live tweets on Twitter given a list of keywords
2. Resolve URLs embedded in all tweets, and construct a domain-domain interaction network based on user co-sharing pattern
3. Extract the largest connected component (which contains news-related domains), and use supervised fake news classifier to score all domains in this component
4. Select domains with a high fakeness score, collect their WHOIS and IP information 
5. Publish the threat intelligence every 24 hours

To learn more details, please read our [paper](https://cybersafety-workshop.github.io/2020/papers/proactive.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Currently Misinformation Discoverer is tracking domains and tweets related to 2020 US election.

### How can those threat intelligence benefit me?
As a reminder, our discovery system is not comprehensive. We only track domain-level fake news sites, and do not track misleading Twitter/Facebook/Reddit posts at this time. Nevertheless, domain remains a popular vehicle to spread misinformation, and we believe that our visualizationa and threat intelligence report can inform journalists, fact-checkers, security researchers and the general public. 

We encourage you to take a look at our reports and graphs. If you find them helpful, contact us and we can email the daily threat intelligence report right to your mailbox.
